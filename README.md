flask-sinatra-martini
----------

A comparison of flask (Python), sinatra (Ruby), and martini (Golang) for building a very simple "blog" web service.

## QuickStart

Each of the applications is fully dockerized so you can run the exact same commands to start each service!

* docker-compose build
* docker-compose up
* sh seed.sh

#### WARNING

If seed.sh fails and you are not using boot2docker you will need to edit the seed file and replace `DOCKER_IP=$(boot2docker ip)` with `DOCKER_IP=localhost`.
